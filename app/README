[![Appcelerator Titanium](http://www-static.appcelerator.com/badges/titanium-git-badge-sq.png)](http://appcelerator.com/titanium/)

Movies is an internal app we built to demonstrate how with Appcelerator you can use JavaScript to deliver beautiful, high-performance native apps entirely indistinguishable from those built in Java or Objective-C (or Swift). 
This application leverages a 3rd party data source for movie listings, to create dynamic app experience. 

## Quick Start

The below instructions assume you already have successfully installed Titanium/Appcelerator Studio and Command Line Tools. If you have not installed Appcelerator toolchain, please review the documentation here:

[Installation and Configuration](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Installation_and_Configuration)

Now, if everything is setup correctly lets get you started with the Movies app.

### Importing and building using Titanium / Appcelerator Studio

* Open Titanium/Appcelerator Studio
* From the menu bar select **File -> Import...** and the **Import** dialog box will open
* In the *Import** dialog, expand the **Git** folder and select **Git Repository as New Project** and click **Next**
* The **Source Repository** dialog is now open. Click on the **URI** radio button and in the text field type or paste **git@github.com:appcelerator/movies.git**
* Click **Finish**

Now, the Movies app will be pulled down from source control and setup into your Studio workspace.

To build the application:

* Select your target from the dropdown and click **Run**

### Importing and building from Command Line

* `cd` into the directory you would like to host the movies app

~~~bash

* clone the this git repository

~~~bash
$> git clone git@github.com:appcelerator/movies.git
~~~

* `cd` to the movies app directory
